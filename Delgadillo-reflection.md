Dealing with conflicts was something I hadn't done *before* the proper way. That was definitely a struggle.

**Pull requests** were clarified during the session, it was great to see a working example.

I asked my pair if he knew any shortcuts to git commit and add (git commit -a -m).

The idea of having so many commits and reverting, and just navigating through them

It was an awesome experience pairing up and guiding and being guided through a challenge. Definitely rooted some ideas down.
